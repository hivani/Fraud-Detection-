# Fraud-Detection-
**#Overview**
This project aims to build a fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes transaction data to identify potentially fraudulent activities and flags them for further investigation.
**Introduction**
Fraudulent activities pose a significant threat to businesses and individuals alike. Detecting and preventing fraud is crucial for maintaining trust and security. This project leverages machine learning techniques to automatically detect fraudulent transactions, helping businesses mitigate risks and protect their assets.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains transactional data including features such as transaction amount, timestamp, merchant information, etc.

**Preprocessing**
The raw data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature scaling and normalization are applied to ensure uniformity across features. Additionally, the data is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.
**Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. Techniques such as binning, encoding, and feature extraction are applied to extract relevant information from the data.

**Model Selection**
Various machine learning algorithms are considered for fraud detection, including but not limited to logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks. The choice of model depends on factors such as interpretability, scalability, and performance metrics.

**Training**
The selected model is trained using the preprocessed data. Hyperparameter tuning may be performed using techniques such as grid search or random search to optimize model performance. Cross-validation is employed to assess the generalization capability of the model.
